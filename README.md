# Optimizing spacecraft trajectories 

Sandbox for prototyping trajectory optimization formulations 

# Transcriptions Methods
## MultiShootingTranscription
A class to transcribe a multi-phase trajectory optimization problem into a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem using multiple shooting. Where each phase is a shooting segment

# Examples 
## Shooting method
 - Single stage to orbit lunar ascent using Linear Tangent Steering 
## Collocation method
 - Single stage to orbit lunar ascent
 - Cart pole 

## Multiple shooting 
 - Multiple shooting cannon 
 - Two degree of freedom Two stage ascent with ball-park aero, exponential atmosphere.
